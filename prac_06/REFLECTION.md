I stopped to finish the whole project in one time but did it one part in a time and test them respectively.

I think I should consider practical as a way to promote my skills in the future rather than just completing homework.

Work on it after I've cleared my mind, and improve it later.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Reduce poor naming problem.
